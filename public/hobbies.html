            <strong><li>Boxing:</li></strong>
            <p>LOL! I am not an actual boxer, since I am concerned about
               it's risk on physical well being, but am really passionate about
               it, so often practice it at home. Besides, it helps feel better.
            </p>
            <strong><li>Reading:</li></strong>
            <p>Every once in a while I like to read about stuff that peaks my interest.
               Main interest area are related to natural sciences but I find it very very 
               interesting to read intersting facts about different animals and plants.
            </p>
            <strong><li>Binge watching Anime:</li></strong>
            <p>University life can be really stressful after hours and hours of study and
               exams, so every so often I look up for unwatched anime to relax and enjoy 
               myself. Side note, I like sports anime, and have soft spot for the old hand
               drawn ones. Not the very old ones though.
